# Executive Summary

## Problem Statement
DDSAnalytics specializes in talent management for Fortune 100 companies. They would like to identify factors that lead to voluntary employee turnover (attrition). We will conduct an analysis of existing employee data to provide some insight into predicting employee turnover. We would like to show that leveraging data science for talent management can be beneficial to the company and provide a competitive edge in the market.

## Analysis
My analysis will begin by first identifying factors that are significantly useful in predicting employee turnover (attrition). To do so I will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the existing employee data to visualize any trends in the data or identify any other existing relationships. We will follow up with classification and predication modeling using the following models:
	- KNN
	- Na√Øve Bayes
	- Linear Regression

## Value
With this analysis of identifying factors that contribute or predict voluntary employee turnover, DDSAnalytics should be able to develop processes and techniques that could help with employee retention. Our hope is that they will be able to leverage data science for other talent management solutions.
